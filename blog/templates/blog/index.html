              <h3>Sakamoto Days</h3>
              <p>
                Sakamoto Days is an action-comedy anime about Taro Sakamoto, a legendary hitman who retires 
                to live a peaceful life as a convenience store owner but gets pulled back into the underworld. 
                With his former skills intact and an oddball crew by his side, he takes on assassins, bounty hunters, 
                and chaos while protecting his family and newfound peace.
